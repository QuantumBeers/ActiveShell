## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **1. Import the Module**

```powershell
Import-Module ./ActiveShell.psm1 -Force
```

### **2. Create a New Graph**

```powershell
Create-ActiveGraph -GraphName "MyGraph" -Type "JSON" -Metadata @{ Creator = "Callum"; Date = (Get-Date) }
```

### **3. Add Nodes**

```powershell
Add-Node -NodeName "PharmacyA" -Type "Pharmacy" -Domain "Healthcare" -Metadata @{ Rating = 4.8; Address = "123 Meds St" }
Add-Node -NodeName "PharmacyB" -Type "Pharmacy" -Domain "Healthcare" -Metadata @{ Rating = 4.9; Address = "789 Meds Lane" }
```

### **4. Create Relationships (Edges)**

```powershell
Create-Edge -Source "PharmacyA" -Target "PharmacyB" -Relationship "PartnersWith"
```

### **5. Query the Graph**

#### Retrieve all nodes:

```powershell
Get-All-Nodes
```

#### Retrieve pharmacies with a rating > 4.5:

```powershell
Get-Node -NodeType "Pharmacy" | Where-Object { $_.Metadata['Rating'] -gt 4.5 }
```

```

### **2. Supply Chains**

Track dependencies between manufacturers, distributors, and retailers:

```powershell
Create-Edge -Source "ManufacturerA" -Target "DistributorA" -Relationship "Supplies"
Create-Edge -Source "DistributorA" -Target "RetailerA" -Relationship "DeliversTo"
```

### **3. Social Networks**

Analyze connections between individuals, organizations, and communities:

```powershell
Create-Edge -Source "UserA" -Target "UserB" -Relationship "FriendsWith"
Create-Edge -Source "UserB" -Target "OrganizationA" -Relationship "MemberOf"
```
